ðŸš€ Day 13: 30 Days of JavaScript - Mastering Modules ðŸš€

Today, I delved into JavaScript modules, a fundamental concept for organizing and reusing code.

Modules are self-contained units of code that can be imported and exported:

Import statements bring in functionality from other modules.
Export statements make functions, variables, or classes available for other modules to use.
Default exports allow for a single default export per module.
Named exports enable multiple named exports from a module.
Understanding modules is essential for building larger and more complex JavaScript applications.
